2025-11-04 19:57:36.405 [info] The `shell` command is not available by default in Poetry versions 2.0.0 and above. Therefore all shell activation will be handled by calling `source <path-to-activate>`. If you face any problems with shell activation, please file an issue at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-environments/issues to help us improve this implementation.
